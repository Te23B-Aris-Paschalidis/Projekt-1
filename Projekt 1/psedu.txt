I will make a dungeon with 5 or 10 stages depends how long it will be
How I will make it:
ask the user for their name
recive information from user 
Ask the user if they want to enter then dungeon
then recive information from the user it does not matter if they choose yes or no they will still get teleported in to the dungeon
When they get in the dungeon it they will enter a waiting room where they can enter lvl 1 of the dungeon
they recive a question from the game where the game asks if you want to have Sword, magic staff
If you choose sword you will recive it in your inventory (list) that is lvl 1 with 5 dmg if you choose magic staff you will recive it the same way as the sword but it will do 5 magic damage.
and then the dungeon will start
